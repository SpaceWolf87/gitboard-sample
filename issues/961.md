# User detail tabs

**Supervisor** can see separate tabs in user detail to separate module management and analytics from profile management.

- add tabs:
    - _Modules_: list of modules and reports
    - _Profile_: everything else
- order based on role:
    - administrator: _Profile_, _Modules_
    - supervisor: _Modules_, _Profile_
- no changes in tabs content
- plus hide roles section for supervisor

Made a **change**.

_This is a change_
